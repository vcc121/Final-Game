import pygame, simpleGE, random


use demo collision detection code  
use demo manyWalls code (as a starting point)

create a player car starting in the top-right corner  
    - uses WASD controls  

create an endpoint in the bottom-left corner  
    - This acts as the level goal  


initialize a score variable  
initialize a timer variable  
    - Score points by reaching the endpoint  
    - Completing a level adds bonus time to the timer  

define level difficulty variables  
    - Start with a small number of obstacles  
    - Increase the number of obstacles as levels progress  
    - Randomize obstacle sizes within a set range  
    - Ensure obstacles do not overlap car during generation  

generate barriers dynamically for each level  
    - Use a loop to create barriers based on the difficulty variable  
    - Assign random sizes and positions within valid screen space  
    - Prevent barriers from overlapping with each other or the player car  

implement WASD controls for the player car:  
    - W to accelerate  
    - A/D to turn   

create a start screen with instructions and buttons  
    - Include "Play" and "Quit" options  
    - Display previous score, if available  

add labels for score, timer, and level during gameplay  
    - Update dynamically as the game progresses  

detect when the player reaches the endpoint:  
    - Increase score based on time left and level difficulty  
    - Add bonus time to the timer  
    - Move to the next level  

end the game when the timer runs out  
    - Display the final score on the game over screen
